# Docker Application Example (Flask)
***
Barker Peeps: Please feel free to use this to quickstart your application. You can always DM me on the Barker Slack or shoot 
me an email at [hand7029@vandals.uidaho.edu](mailto:hand7029@vandals.uidaho.edu).

Core Bootstrap 5.0.2 has been dropped into the static folder, which means you'll have to add optional dependancies like 
Popper if you are going to use them (I'm mainly assuming that you are making interfaces for quant applications).

P.S. The trade log has an API, so that may be a time-saving solution to keep track of your trading. You can grab your API 
key from your dashboard and view the documentation [here](https://docs.api.tylerhand.com).
